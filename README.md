### Hi there 👋

I'm Ramesh Babu - Automation Architect in [Computer Enterprises, Inc.](https://www.ceiamerica.com/) and also an active open source contributor on GitHub.

Being lazy by nature, I tend to automate everything which I need to do manually. This thinking keeps me motivated to learn new testing tools, new technologies and best practices. I keep challenging myself to push my limits and move out of my comfort zone and upgrade my skills. And also I like mentoring people who are as eager to learn as I am.

## My work
There are many libraries and test frameworks which I have created and open sourced, same you can also use in any of your projects with minimal on-boarding time. All my works, with it’s documentation can be found in projects section. Feel free to check it out.

Note: There are many projects on my GitHub but the same is not yet available in the projects section. I am working on adding documentations for all of them, which I will publish as soon as it is ready.

I am open to feedback, so you are welcome to use any of my projects and share your feedback on how good it was or how it can be improved.
